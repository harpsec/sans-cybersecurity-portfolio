# sans-cybersecurity-portfolio
Hi, I’m Khalli Harper. After leaving the military, a close friend suggested I explore cybersecurity—a field I hadn’t even considered before. Intrigued, I dove into research, devouring everything I could find. That rapid learning curve landed me my first civilian role, and today I work as a web‑application penetration tester for a Fortune 500 company. While I’m sharpening my skills on the job, I’m also earning a cybersecurity degree at the SANS Technology Institute, where my coursework focuses heavily on ethical hacking. This blend of hands‑on experience and formal study fuels my passion for protecting digital assets.

I don’t have a lot of CTF experience. I usually learn by doing hands‑on labs. The NCL Fall 2025 competition was actually my first CTF. Since then I’ve realized that CTFs are a great way to get creative, even if they aren’t always realistic, because they let you apply and sharpen your skills. I enjoy the gamified learning style, it helps develop abilities without feeling forced. That said, I still prefer lab platforms like those from PortSwigger to develope my skills.😎
